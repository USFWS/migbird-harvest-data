## Introduction

The migbirdHarvestData package provides an easy-to-use automated workflow for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to wrangle, tidy, and visualize Harvest Information Program data.

The package can be installed using:
```{r, install, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("USFWS/migbirdHarvestData")
```

The flowchart below is a handy visual guide to the order in which functions are used.

```{r flowchart_svg, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Overview of migbirdHarvestData functions in a flowchart format.", out.width = "100%", dev = "svg", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/migbirdHarvestData_flowchart.svg")
```

## Stage 1: Import Data

### read_hip

The first step is to import .txt files containing HIP data. To do this, we use the `read_hip` function.

```{r, readhip, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(migbirdHarvestData)

DL1202 <- read_hip("C:/HIP/DL1202")
```

Did you get a warning or three? Read an explanation of common `read_hip` warnings, [below](#common-read_hip-warnings).

### tidy

After data are imported, we `tidy`:

```{r, tidy}
DL1202_tidied <- tidy(DL1202)
```

This function renames columns and does simple mutations, such as:

* Converts names to uppercase
* Moves suffixes from first or last name columns to the appropriate suffix column
* Removes punctuation from middle initial column
* Removes ending hyphen from zip codes with only 5 digits

### validate

The next intermediate step is to `validate` the data. This function should be run after `tidy` to assess the data for repeated values in two dimensions, both vertically and horizontally.

<b>Vertically.</b> The vertical check searches within each column for repetition. Any species group column with a uniform value in all rows will be detected. *Coming soon:* States that do not have a hunting season for one or more species groups (e.g. seaducks) will not be returned using this function for reporting all zero values.

The two time period options to assess vertical repetition are `period = "dl_date"` (used automatically)...

```{r, validate_v}
validate(DL1202_tidied, type = "vertical")
```

... and `period = "dl_cycle"`.

```{r, validate_v_time}
validate(DL1202_tidied, type = "vertical", period = "dl_cycle")
```

<b>Horizontally.</b> The horizontal check for repetition looks across records. This function will return results if one or more rows have the same value in each species group column.

```{r, validate_h}
validate(DL1202_tidied, type = "horizontal")
```

If there are no uniformities, a positive message will be returned.

Tibbles of vertical repetition returned from this function can be looked at more closely using `investigate` (see Stage 3: [investigate](#investigate)).

### strataCheck

Running `strataCheck` is the last step we must do to ensure the data are in order. This function searches for values in species group columns that are not typical or expected by the FWS. If a value outside of the normal strata is given, the output tibble will create a row for it. The row will contain the state, species, unusual stratum value, and a column called "normal_strata" with the typical values we would expect.

If a value for a species group is given in the HIP data that doesn't match anything in our records, the species reported in the output will have NA values in the "normal_strata" column. These species are not hunted in the reported states.

```{r, stratacheck}
strataCheck(DL1202_tidied)
```

### proof

After data are tidied and checked for any important issues that would require manual attention, we `proof`:

```{r, proof}
DL1202_proofed <- proof(DL1202_tidied, year = 2020)
```

Data that are considered irregular are flagged in a new column called "errors". No actual corrections take place in this step; all data remain identical except for the new "errors" column. For each field, values are compared to standard expected formats and if they do not conform, the field name is pasted as a string in the "errors" column. Each row can have from zero errors (NA) to all column names listed. Multiple flags are hyphen delimited.

The year of the Harvest Information Program must be supplied as a parameter. This aids in checking dates when licenses were issued, as one example.

## Stage 2: Visualize Data

### errorPlot_fields

The `errorPlot_fields` function can be run on all states...

```{r errorfieldsplotall, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Plot of all location's errors by field name.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.6, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
errorPlot_fields(DL1202_proofed, loc = "all")
```

... or it can be limited to just one.

```{r errorfieldsplotsc, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Plot of all North Carolina's errors by field name.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.6, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
errorPlot_fields(DL1202_proofed, loc = "NC")
```

The year in which the HIP data were collected can also be specified in `errorPlot_fields` to visualize the proportion of "errors" created by youth hunters and Canadian zip codes, since these values fall outside the expected parameters of the `proof` function. It is encouraged to use `specify` when error counts are high to increase transparency by revealing which errors are attributable to a specific cause. This feature should also help maintain confidence in the integrity of the data.

```{r errorfieldsplotyouth, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Plot of all location's errors by field name, with stacked colors to indicate if there are youth hunters or Canadian zip codes in the data, two common causes of error.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.6, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
errorPlot_fields(DL1202_proofed, specify = 2020)
```

It is possible to add any `ggplot2` components to these plots. For season total data specifically, the plot can be facet_wrapped using either dl_cycle or dl_date. The example below demonstrates how this package's functions can interact with the tidyverse and shows an example of an `errorPlot_fields` facet_wrap (using a subset of 4 download cycles)

```{r errorfieldsfacet, eval = FALSE}
errorPlot_fields(
  hipdata2020 %>%
    filter(str_detect(dl_cycle, "0800|0901|0902|1001")),
  specify = 2020) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(~dl_cycle, ncol = 2)
```

```{r errorfieldsfacet_example, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "errorfieldsfacet example output", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/errorPlot_fields_facet.png")
```


### errorPlot_states

The `errorPlot_states` function plots states above a specified proportion of error. Bar labels are error counts.

```{r errorplotstates, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Plot of proportion of error by state.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
errorPlot_states(DL1202_proofed, threshold = .01)
```

### findDuplicates

The `findDuplicates` function finds registrants that have more than one record. Registrations are grouped by first name, last name, city, state, birth date, and download state. If the same registrant has 2 or more records, the fields that are not identical are counted and summarized in a tibble and plot.

```{r findDuplicates, fig.cap = "Figure 6. Plot of types of duplicates.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.5, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
findDuplicates(DL1202_proofed)
```

### outOfStateHunters

The `outOfStateHunters` function plots and tabulates how many hunters registered in a download state that does not match the state, province, or territory of their address. This function plots proportion of out-of-staters with counts as bar labels. The tibble contains counts and proportions by state.

```{r outofstate, fig.cap = "Figure 8. Plot of proportions of out-of-state hunters.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
outOfStateHunters(DL1202_proofed)
```

### youthHunters

The `youthHunters` function returns a table and plot of the number of hunters with birth dates < 16 years from the year of HIP data collection. These data are interesting to explore because hunters younger than 16 years of age are not required to have a migratory bird hunting license in the United States.

```{r youth, fig.cap = "Figure 9. Plot of proportions of youth hunters.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3.5, dpi = 300, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center"}
youthHunters(DL1202_proofed, year = 2020)
```

### errorPlot_dl

This function should not be used unless you want to visualize an entire season of data. The `errorPlot_dl` function plots total errors per download cycle across the year. Location may be specified to see a particular state over time.

```{r errorPlot_dl, eval = FALSE}
errorPlot_dl(hipdata2020, loc = "MI")
```

```{r errorplotdl_example, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "errorPlot_dl example output", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/errorPlot_dl.png")
```

## Stage 3: Explore Errors

### investigate

Did the `validate` function return repeated values? Are some of those values a high number that are uniform and need to be looked at more closely? The `investigate` function allows you to see what value was vertically repeated for a species. Parameters required are download state, type of download time period, value of the download date or download cycle, and species, which are all provided in the output of [validate](#validate).

```{r investigate}
investigate(DL1202_tidied, loc = "TX", period_type = "dl_date", period = "20201216", species = "cranes")
```

### errorTable

The `errorTable` function is a flexible way to obtain error data as a tibble, which can be assessed as needed or exported to create records of download cycle errors. The basic function reports errors by both location and field.

```{r errortable1}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed)
```

Errors can be reported by only location by turning off the `field` parameter.

```{r errortable2}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, field = "none")
```

Errors can be reported by only field by turning off the `loc` parameter.

```{r errortable3}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, loc = "none")
```

Location can be specified.

```{r errortable4}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, loc = "CA")
```

Field can be specified.

```{r errortable5}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, field = "suffix")
```

Total errors for a location can be pulled.

```{r errortable6}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, loc = "CA", field = "none")
```

Total errors for a field in a particular location can be pulled.

```{r errortable7}
errorTable(DL1202_proofed, loc = "CA", field = "dove_bag")
```

### pullErrors

The `pullErrors` function can be used to view all of the actual values that were flagged as errors in a particular field. In this example, we find that the "dove_bag" field contains entries of "4" and "9", when the only values permissible are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.

```{r pullerrors}
pullErrors(DL1202_proofed, error = "dove_bag")
```

### redFlags

<b>By state.</b>
States with an unacceptable level of error can be pulled into a tibble. The tibble contains information pertaining to state, the count of errors from that state, the number of correct records from that state, the proportion of error per state, and a "flag" column that prints the threshold used. Any threshold can be supplied; in this example, we see which states had more than 3% error.

```{r redflags1}
redFlags(DL1202_proofed, type = "state", threshold = 0.03)
```

<b>By field.</b>
The same can be done for data fields. In this example, we see which fields had more than 1% error.

```{r redflags2}
redFlags(DL1202_proofed, type = "field", threshold = 0.01)
```

## Stage 4: Correct and Compare

### correct

After the download data are proofed, the next step is to fix the data to the best of our ability. Data can be corrected by running the `correct` function on the proofed tibble.

```{r correct}
DL1202_corrected <- correct(DL1202_proofed, year = 2020)
```

The following changes are made by the `correct` function:

* *Title* is changed to NA if it does not equal 1 or 2
* *First name* is not changed, but remains flagged as an error if it breaks a following rule:
    * Not > 1 letter
    * Contains a first initial and middle name
    * Contains a first name and middle initial
    * Contains non-alpha characters other than space or hyphen
    * No full names (detected with 2+ spaces)
    * Is not "BLANK", "INAUDIBLE", "TEST", "USER", or "RESIDENT"
* *Middle initial* is not changed, but remains flagged if it is not exactly 1 letter
* *Last name* is not changed, but remains flagged as an error if it breaks a following rule:
    * Not > 1 letter
    * Contains a non-alpha character other than space, period, hyphen, or apostrophe
    * No full names (Detected with 2+ spaces)
    * Is not "INAUDIBLE"
* *Suffix* is changed to NA if it is not equal to:
    * JR or SR
    * A value from II to VII in Roman numerals
    * An value from 2ND to 9TH
* *Address* is not changed, but remains flagged if it contains a |, tab, or non-UTF8 character
* *City* is not changed, but remains flagged if it contains any non-alpha character
* *State* is not changed, but remains flagged if it is not contained in the following list of abbreviations for US and Canada states, provinces, and territories:
    * AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, AS, GU, MP, PR, VI, UM, FM, MH, PW, AA, AE, AP, CM, CZ, NB, PI, TT, ON, QC, NS, NB, MB, BC, PE, SK, AB, NL
* *Zip* is corrected by:
    * Inserting a hyphen into continuous 9-digit zip codes
    * Replacing a central space with a hyphen
    * Deleting trailing -0000 and -____
    * Checking corrected zip codes against a master list of USA postal codes; if the hunter's address doesn't have a zip that should be in their state, it's flagged
    * Foreign zip codes are flagged
    * Zip codes that do not match a 5-digit or 9-digit hyphenated format are flagged
* *Birth date* is not changed, but remains flagged if the birth year was > 100 or < 16 years ago
* *Issue date* is not changed, but remains flagged if it is not equal to or +/- 1 year from the HIP data collection year
* *Hunt migratory birds* is not changed, and remains flagged if it is not equal to 1 or 2
* *Bag values*
    * State numbers that do not meet expected parameters are compared to a master list by state and species, then corrected to the standard FWS format
    * Any parameter that can't be converted is changed to NA
* *Registration year* is not changed, but remains flagged if it is not equal to or +/- 1 year from the HIP data collection year
* *Email* is corrected by:
    * Removing spaces, commas, and/or forward slash symbols
    * Changing to lowercase
    * Replacing multiple @ symbols with a single @
    * Adding periods and three-letter endings to common domains, including:
        * gmail -> gmail.com
        * yahoo -> yahoo.com
        * aol -> aol.com
        * comcast -> comcast.net
        * verizon -> verizon.net
        * cox -> cox.net
        * outlook -> outlook.com
        * hotmail -> hotmail.com
    * Replace .ccom with .com
    * Add missing periods before net, com, edu, and gov
    * Change email to NA if:
        * There is no @ symbol in the email string
        * If the email is invalid (i.e. none<!-- breaklink -->@none, noemail, n/a)
    * Any email that wasn't corrected and doesn't fit the standardized email regex remains flagged

The year of the Harvest Information Program must be supplied as a parameter. Since the "errors" column is re-created using `correct`, supplying the year is necessary for the same reasons it is required by `proof`.

All functions in [Stage 2](#stage-2-visualize-data) and [Stage 3](#stage-3-explore-errors) will run on the corrected tibble, `DL1202_corrected`, just as they worked on the example tibble `DL1202_proofed`. Errors can be compared between the proofed stage and corrected stage to get a better idea of which errors were serious (i.e. difficult to correct automatically) and determine how serious errors can be prevented in the future.

### manualFix

The automated `correct` function cannot always catch and fix every error. To finish the job, `manualFix` function replaces specified inaccurate values with the values you want. It is not recommended that this function only be used after correcting the data; it's best used on a case-by-case basis. In the instance of frame shifts, for example, it would be wise to use after `tidy`. Or if problems are only identified after `proof`, you can run `manualFix` on the tidied data and re-run `proof`. This function is highly flexible and recommended to be used as needed.

```{r manualfix, eval = FALSE}
manualFix(DL1202_corrected, field = "state", error_value = "GS", correct_value = "GA")
```

## Stage 5: Write and Sample

### writeReport

The `writeReport` function can be used to automatically generate an R markdown document with figures, tables, and summary statistics. This can be done at the end of a download cycle (using `type = "dl_report"`) or the entire HIP season (with `type = "season_report"`). You should expect this function to run for ~1 minute for a download cycle, or ~30 minutes for a total season (containing approximately 4 million records). Writing a total season report is a memory intensive process, so for this option, we recommend [increasing your memory](#memory-problems) allocated to R.

```{r, writerpt, eval = FALSE}

# Windows only
memory.limit(size = 55000)

writeReport(
  path = "C:/HIP/all_2019",
  type = "season_report",
  yr = 2019,
  dir = "H:/r_projects/hip_data/script",
  file = "gadget")

```

### hunterSample

After correcting the data, the `hunterSample` function subsets hunters without any errors in their records, ensuring each hunter has a valid mailing address, email address, registration year, and issue date. The function can be run with or without the "random" parameter. If the "random" parameter is used, the specified number of records will be randomly sampled from the corrected data (a non-reproducible event). Without specifying "random", all valid hunters in the data will be returned.

```{r, huntersample, eval = FALSE}

hunterSample(DL1202_corrected, random = 100)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common read_hip warnings

Sometimes `read_hip` will throw one or more warnings. Warnings are usually benign, but for clarity I provide examples and explanations of common warnings below. If the warning or error you receive after reading HIP data isn't described here and seems like a real problem, please [report an issue](#other).

<b>Example 1.</b> This parsing failure occurs when a .txt file is missing the last two columns in the fixed-width file (registration_yr and email). For the offending file(s), these columns are filled with NA in the output tibble. No action must be taken.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example 1. Common warning that results after running read_hip with missing columns in fixed-width text files.", out.width = "60%", dpi = 300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/parsing_failure_1.png")
```

<b>Example 2.</b> Another version of a parsing failure occurs when a file is missing the last column in last row of the fixed-width file. This value is set to NA in the output tibble. No action must be taken.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example 2. Common warning that results after running read_hip with a missing column in one row of a fixed-width text file.", out.width = "60%", dpi = 300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/parsing_failure_2.png")
```

### Memory problems

Some of these functions require a lot of memory to run. To help your R process these data, especially when working with the large season totals, you can do a few things:

1. Remove objects from the environment. If you have already run `read_hip`, `tidy`, and `proof`, you may no longer need your original dataframe or your tidied dataframe, since most error checking functions work from the proofed or corrected versions of the data. To remove an unneeded object like the tidied dataframe, run `rm(DL1202_tidied)`.

2. Check your memory using `memory.limit()`

3. Increase your memory, e.g. `memory.limit(size = 55000)`
