## Overview

The migbirdHarvestData package provides an easy-to-use set of R functions for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Program to wrangle, tidy, and visualize [Harvest Information Program](https://www.fws.gov/harvestsurvey) data.

Tasks that can be accomplished with this package include:

* `read_hip` imports data
* `clean` does basic reorganization tasks
* `findDuplicates` identifies registrants with multiple records
* `fixDuplicates` consolidates duplicate records
* `strataCheck` identifies any new strata
* `validate` checks for table-wide repetition
* `investigate` reports details on repeated values
* `proof` checks values for errors
* `correct` systematically fixes erroneous values
* `manualFix` lets the user fix any remaining unsatisfactory values
* Error visualization with `errorPlot_dl`, `errorPlot_fields`, and `errorPlot_states`
* Exploration of specific errors with `youthHunters` and `outOfStateHunters`
* Detailed error reporting with `errorTable`, `pullErrors`, and `redFlags`
* Automated report writing with `writeReport` and `writeShiny`
* Custom .csv writing with `write_hip`
